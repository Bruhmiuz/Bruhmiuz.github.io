/*
Each message node in the dialogue system must include a defined structure to ensure consistent behavior and rendering.

Required and Optional Fields:

1. type (string) ‚Äî One of the following six message types:
   - "plain"        ‚Üí Standard text message.
   - "image"        ‚Üí Image message (loads from the `images/` folder).
   - "dialogue"     ‚Üí Dialogue-based user options.
   - "mcq"          ‚Üí Multiple-select MCQ (can select more than one).
   - "single-mcq"   ‚Üí Single-select MCQ (only one correct option).
   - "text"         ‚Üí Open-ended text input.

2. content (string)
   - For all types except "image": The message text (can include LaTeX).
   - For "image": Filename of the image (relative to the `images/` folder).

3. next (string) ‚Äî [Required for all types except "dialogue"]
   - ID of the next node to load after this one.
   - For MCQ types, this is triggered after optional feedback responses (see `respondToIdx`).
   - Not required for:
     - "dialogue" nodes (use `respondToIdx` instead),
     - final message nodes,
     - intermediate response messages.

4. delay (number) ‚Äî [Optional]
   - Additional delay in milliseconds before showing this node (defaults to 500ms base delay).

5. options (object) ‚Äî [Required for "dialogue", "mcq", and "single-mcq"]
   - A dictionary mapping option keys (typically numbers) to display labels.

6. answersIdx (Set<number>) ‚Äî [Required for "mcq" and "single-mcq"]
   - A `Set` containing the keys of correct answers.

7. respondToIdx (object) ‚Äî [Required for "dialogue", optional for "mcq"/"single-mcq"]
   - A mapping of selected option keys to follow-up node IDs.
   - For "dialogue", this is mandatory and determines branching.
   - For MCQ types, it optionally provides feedback nodes for selected options.

8. answers (Set<string>) ‚Äî [Required for "text"]
   - A set of accepted correct text answers (case- and space-insensitive matching is applied).

9. marks (number) ‚Äî [Optional for "mcq", "single-mcq", and "text"]
   - Maximum score awarded for correctly answering the node.
   - Scoring is skipped if this is undefined.
